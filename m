The racial issues are wider than that, and even wider again I'm sure,
but in 2020 this is as good a place to start as any, and the trigger
as that sentence says was in 2020, there was a reckoning about it
mainly due to people of African descent. That trigger has had flow on
effects in other countries, but I'm not sure that sentence in any way
diminishes that, it's merely an introduction to why this change is
happening now.

As for the non-black slavery, others have never pointed this out
before in 30 years of master/slave terminology? surely if white
slavery was as big a problem, they be as supportive of this, even more
so. It speaks volumes that I've never heard white slavery as a problem
once in 30 years, but now I'm hearing about it a few times, and
somehow as an excuse not to support this.

Dave.
