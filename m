Aleksa, I know you had an entire presentation[1] on the extensible
argument syscalls, but was there any text-based design doc that you made?

It would be really nice to update Documentation/process/adding-syscalls.rst
with the specifics[2], and to (now) include the "no nested flags"
requirement. What do you think?
