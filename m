Oh, I understood the question differently.  I thought it was about
"sub: system: Fix foo" vs. "sub: system: fix foo".

For simple and trivial things, I tend to make changes while applying, as that's
usually less work than complaining, and verifying that it's been fixed in the
next (if any) version n days/weeks/months later.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
