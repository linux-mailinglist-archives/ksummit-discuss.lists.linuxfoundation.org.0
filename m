To me, "Reported-by:" is associated with "this person reported the
problem being fixed by this commit". For these kinds of larger commits,
that may not be sensible. I.e. it's some larger feature that the "I
found a problem with this commit" author wasn't even involved in.

I think it's important to capture those in some way, even if they're
not considered "copyrightable" or whatever -- that's not the bar I'm
interested in; I want to make sure people are acknowledged for the time
and effort they spent. And whether we like it or not, these kinds of
tags do that. Besides, such fix authors have expressly asked for this,
which should be sufficient reason enough to find a solution.

"Co-developed-by", to me, has a connotation of significant authorship.
For the "weaker" cases, I tend to use "Suggested-by" or put something
like "Based on a patch by $person[link]" in the body.

For the kinds of fixes mentioned here, and more specifically for the
kinds of fixes that I have received from both Colin Ian King and Dan
Carpenter that fall into this "tiny fix"[1] category, I think something
simply like "Adjusted-by" could be used. I've already tried to include
"Link" tags to things that got folded in, but without the Adjusted-by tag,
it lacks the right kind of searchability and recognition.

"Fixes-by" is too close to "Fixes" (and implies more than one
fix). "Fixup-by" implies singular. "Debugged-by" is like the other
existing high-level tags, in that they speak to the ENTIRE patch.

If not "Adjusted-by", what about "Tweaked-by", "Helped-by",
"Corrected-by"?

Colin, Dan, any thoughts on how you'd like to see stuff?

[1] "tiny" in the sense of characters changed, usually. There was very
    much NOT a "tiny" amount of time spent on it, nor do they have "tiny"
    impact -- which is the whole point of calling this out in the
    commit.
