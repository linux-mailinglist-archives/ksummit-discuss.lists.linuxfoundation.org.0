For after the fact post-processing of tags to generate summary
reports, is there a significant difference between Reported-by for
"original commit motivation" and Reported-by for "follow-on fixups"?
Especially since this practice of Reported-by for fixups is already
deployed in the tree (at least kbuild-robot credit reports and my
subsystems operate this way).

If the fix is a slightly late and needs to come as a follow-on patch
the tag will be Reported-by on that fix. I fail to perceive a benefit
in augmenting the tag to indicate the resolution of the race condition
of the commit making it upstream.
