Agreed.
We also have simpler ways of doing this which were brought up here multiple
times and which can likely be automated and or gain more adoption if properly documented.
Here's an example of how a bunch of people (including me) are already
doing this. All commits currently in my tree that had multiple versions
do as the last line have a lore-Link tag. (This is based on the script
by Kees that came out of a prior discussion.). Here is an example for
the waitid patch for 5.4-rc1
( https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/brauner/linux.git/commit/?h=pidfd&id=590ef0128b4277eaa9cb74d7ba878d48b261950c ):

	waitid: Add support for waiting for the current process group
	It was recently discovered that the linux version of waitid is not a
	superset of the other wait functions because it does not include support
	
	[...]
	
	Signed-off-by: "Eric W. Biederman" <ebiederm@xmission.com>
	Signed-off-by: Christian Brauner <christian.brauner@ubuntu.com>
	[...]
	Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20190814154400.6371-2-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com

If you click on that link it takes you to the patch sent to the mailing
list that was actually applied. The actual version might differ because
of merge-conflict resolution. In this example it was v3. The cover
letter for v3
( https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190814154400.6371-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/ )
contains lore-Links to all previous versions of the patchset:

	Hey everyone,
	
	[...]
	
	Thanks!
	Christian
	
	/* v0 */
	Link: https://www.sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2019-07/msg00587.html
	
	/* v1 */
	Link: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190814113822.9505-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/
	
	/* v2 */
	Link: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190814130732.23572-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com

That's a pretty simple trail to all versions of the patchset. If no
cover letter is wanted or needed placing it after --- works just as
well.

As long as you have the link to the prior version in the patchset you
can even skip this part.
