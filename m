I presumably wasn't clear in my proposal.  My apologies and I will try
to be clearer.  I am proposing this:

1. I post v1 of my patch series to public mailing lists, like LKML.
Each patch in the series is tagged with a Change-Id which my own PC
made up.  I never touch a gerrit server anywhere.

2. I post v2 of my patch series to a public mailing list.  I make sure
that patches that are supposed to be newer versions of the same patch
in v1 contain the same Change-Id that they had in v1.  This is
something I already know how to do since sometimes I use gerrit and
that's how you work with gerrit.  I still haven't touched a single
gerrit server in this process.

3. The patch lands and still has the Change-Id.

Someone looking at the git history in the kernel can find the old
versions by searching public mailing lists for the Change-Id simply
using the standard ways to search mailing lists for a string.  There
is nothing excluding anyone here and it should be useful for everyone.

Someone doing a search of the mailing lists that finds patch v1 can
note the Change-Id and search the same mailing lists (and the kernel
history) for that Change-Id.  They can find it because the same string
was in v1 and v2.

I do not believe that there is any way to start with the Message-Id of
v2 of a patch and easily find v1 of the same patch.  Things like
cregit and email2git may have heuristics here, but I'm fairly certain
that they are not guaranteed to work.  I am happy to be corrected
here.  I can also spend time finding examples of cregit and email2git
failing if needed.

At the moment there is a chicken-and-egg problem.  We can't create
such a tool until Change-Id is there and Change-Id can't be there till
there is a tool.  However, I guess that could be solved by convincing
someone to create a tool that would return a list of emails that match
a given string.  Presumably such a tool would need to be hosted on
kernel.org.

NOTE: part of the usefulness of Change-Id is that it could be parsed
by a machine so that tools such as patchwork, gerrit, or other
not-yet-invented tools can always find the Change-Id.  If we were to
post it as a URL, I would want to make sure that everyone always used
the same URL.

I would further note that when you do "git log" each change is listed
with a random number (the git hash), not:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=59c36bc8d377c8764eb617a92211e0fc2f1318da

...so there is at least one precedent where people accept having an
ID, not a clickable URL.

So I'm hoping that I addressed this above in saying that the Change-Id
I'm talking about has nothing to do with any gerrit server.  The
database is public because it is the existing mailing list archive.
Any use of the same Change-Id on an internal gerrit server is
meaningless in the context of my proposal.
