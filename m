Wherever possible the kernel should use the same terminology as the current
standard in that area. Many of the master/slave references in the networking
code are for protocols based on IEEE 802 standards (unfortunately paywalled).
The current version of those standards do not use this kind of wording and the
standards committees are also actively working on inclusive language statemets.

As far as the use of master/slave for bonding, bridge, team etc, it
looks like Linux just invented using those terms since I don't see it
any other vendors implementations Cisco/Juniper/Arista/... Linux terms
are different than industry norms in networking, this is not a good
thing. But changing human expectations is hard.
