While I agree that using terms that can only be understood given a
cultural context that not everyone may share, I would think that better
examples would be references to movies/novels etc.

Though I'm not sure if blueprint translates literally into other
languages, it did actually have a logical reason, viz engineering
drawings used to be blue/white. But logical reasons don't have to exist.
In the case of colors, for example, using red-black tree doesn't exclude
blind people, precisely because there is no logical reason for using the
colors red and black, or even colors at all, so it's not as if you gain
any additional insight into the structure if you are able to see the
colors. It just needs _some_ arbitrary labels for distinguishing two
classes of nodes, it could just as well have been named A-B tree or 0-1
tree or whatever. I don't think there is any concise way to label them
that conveys anything useful about how they're used in the data
structure -- you just have to learn about the structure and how it's
used. This isn't the case with whitelist/blacklist, where those colors
actually have connotations about what the two lists mean.
