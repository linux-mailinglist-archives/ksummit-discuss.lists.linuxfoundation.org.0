Thorsten, I generally support this initiative. I am just wondering:

What is the definition of an issue for you?

Just four examples that come to my mind:

- all the warnings that Stephen Rothwell reports on linux-next, such
as https://lore.kernel.org/linux-next/20210322170452.726525e8@canb.auug.org.au/
or https://lore.kernel.org/linux-next/20210322075108.3967d5d1@canb.auug.org.au/?
- all the issues that the kernel test robot reports?
- all the errors and warnings that kernel ci reports? Basically, each
"issue" that is already aggregated in this email,
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-next/6058787c.1c69fb81.d3f10.8c6d@mx.google.com/?
- all the syzbot reports?

Are you including all those automatic testing and checking efforts as
reporting valid "issues"? Or would you like to keep this list only for
reports from single individual human users that need to detect the
"issue" without using one of the tools above?

Lukas
