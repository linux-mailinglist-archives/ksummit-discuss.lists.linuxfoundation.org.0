Last year I too was on site, but missed the election meeting as I was too
busy running Plumbers ;-) (Like you were running ELC) And I too was elected.
But last year was the first time we had electronic voting and you could vote
without being at the election. You only had to be present at the conference.

Last year we also removed the speech and instead only had the published
statements.
