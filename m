Hey,

I would like to stand for election to the Technical Advisory Board.

I have been an active kernel contributor for about 5 years and a
maintainer for about 2 years. I've been working on various parts of the
kernel spanning multiple subsystems but often like to concentrate on
process management, parts of the vfs, and security.
I'm involved in developing and maintaining core technologies in the
kernel that are in use in virtually all container runtimes and most
sandboxing solutions across userspace. As a member of the TAB I'd like
to help further the adoption of security relevant container features
across the industry.

Being a maintainer of large userspace projects too, I have worked to
bring kernel development and low-level userspace closer together. This
aims to ensure improved API design and increased security for all
distros and companies. This has already proven useful as we were adding
various new userspace APIs that have seen rapid adoption over the last
two years.

I really enjoy being part of the organizing committee of the Linux
Plumbers conference this year. A healthy relationship between the Linux
Foundation and Linux Plumbers and other kernel conferences is vital for
the kernel community. Being a member of the TAB I'd like to maintain and
strengthen that relationship!

Being on the TAB I would also like to enable more young developers to
take on responsibility in the kernel community. The TAB also is a great
opportunity to not just help bring in new ideas but also to listen and
learn from already established members.

I am extremely grateful for the encouragement and nudges from existing
and former TAB members to stand for election this year!

I'm always happy to answer any questions and welcome feedback of course.
Just write me a mail or message me on Twitter (@brau_ner).

Thank you!
Christian
