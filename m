+Media Subsystem Profile
+=======================
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+The media subsystem cover support for a variety of devices: stream
+capture, analog and digital TV, cameras, remote controllers, HDMI CEC
+and media pipeline control.
+
+It covers, mainly, the contents of those directories:
+
+  - drivers/media
+  - drivers/staging/media
+  - Documentation/media
+  - include/media
+
+Both media userspace and Kernel APIs are documented and should be kept in
+sync with the API changes. It means that all patches that add new
+features to the subsystem should also bring changes to the corresponding
+API files.
+
+Also, patches for device drivers that changes the Open Firmware/Device
+Tree bindings should be reviewed by the Device Tree maintainers.
+
+Due to the size and wide scope of the media subsystem, media's
+maintainership model is to have sub-maintainers that have a broad
+knowledge of an specific aspect of the subsystem. It is a
+sub-maintainers task to review the patches, providing feedback to users
+if the patches are following the subsystem rules and are properly using
+the media internal and external APIs.
+
+Patches for the media subsystem should be sent to the media mailing list
+at linux-media@vger.kernel.org as plain text only e-mail. Emails with
+HTML will be automatically rejected by the mail server. There's no need
+to copy the maintainer or sub-maintainer(s).
+
+Media's workflow is heavily based on Patchwork, meaning that, once a patch
+is submitted, it should appear at:
+
+   - https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/project/linux-media/list/
+
+If it doesn't automatically appear there after a few minutes, then
+probably something got wrong on your submission. Please check if the
+email is in plain text only and if your emailer is not mangling with
+whitespaces before complaining or submit it again.
+
+Sub-maintainers
++++++++++++++++
+
+At the media subsystem, we have a group of senior developers that are
+responsible for doing the code reviews at the drivers (called
+sub-maintainers), and another senior developer responsible for the
+subsystem as a hole. For core changes, whenever possible, multiple
+media (sub-)maintainers do the review.
+
+The sub-maintainers work on specific areas of the subsystem, as
+described below:
+
+Digital TV:
+  Sean Young <sean@mess.org>
+
+HDMI CEC:
+  Hans Verkuil <hverkuil@xs4all.nl>
+
+Media controller drivers:
+  Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>
+
+Remote Controllers:
+  Sean Young <sean@mess.org>
+
+Sensor drivers:
+  Sakari Ailus <sakari.ailus@linux.intel.com>
+
+V4L2 drivers:
+  Hans Verkuil <hverkuil@xs4all.nl>
+
+Submit Checklist Addendum
+-------------------------
+
+There is a set of compliance tools at https://git.linuxtv.org/v4l-utils.git/
+that should be used in order to check if the drivers are properly
+implementing the media APIs.
+
+Those tests need to be passed before the patches go upstream.
+
+Also, please notice that we build the Kernel with::
+
+	make CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y C=1 W=1 CHECK=check_script
+
+Where the check script is::
+
+	#!/bin/bash
+	/devel/smatch/smatch -p=kernel $@ >&2
+	/devel/sparse/sparse $@ >&2
+
+Be sure to not introduce new warnings on your patches.
+
+Key Cycle Dates
+---------------
+
+New submissions can be sent at any time, but if they intend to hit the
+next merge window they should be sent before -rc5, and ideally stabilized
+in the linux-media branch by -rc6.
+
+Coding Style Addendum
+---------------------
+
+Media development uses checkpatch on strict mode to verify the code style, e. g.::
+
+	$ ./script/checkpatch.pl --strict
+
+Review Cadence
+--------------
+
+Provided that your patch is at https://patchwork.linuxtv.org, it should
+be sooner or later handled, so you don't need to re-submit a patch.
+
+Except for bug fixes, we don't usually add new patches to the development
+tree between -rc6 and the next -rc1.
+
+Please notice that the media subsystem is a high traffic one, so it
+could take a while for us to be able to review your patches. Feel free
+to ping if you don't get a feedback on a couple of weeks or to ask
+other developers to publicly add Reviewed-by and, more importantly,
+Tested-by tags.
+
+Please notice that we expect a detailed description for Tested-by,
+identifying what boards were used at the test and what it was tested.
+
+Style Cleanup Patches
+---------------------
+
+Style-cleanups are welcome when they come together with other changes
+at the files where the style changes will affect.
+
+We may accept pure standalone style-cleanups, but they should be grouped
+per directory. So, for example, if you're doing a cleanup at drivers
+under drivers/media, please send a single patch for all drivers under
+drivers/media/pci, another one for drivers/media/usb and so on.
