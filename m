That's not an interesting second-level case. Either turn it on or off;
base it on set_tid_size which tells you whether someone requested it or
not. There's absolutely no reason to filter around in set_tid size ([1]).
That was considered when adding this for checkpoint restore. You either
allow someone that is sufficiently capable in the owning user namespace
of each pid namespace it wants to select specific pids in or you simply
deny it. That's not a great strawman.

Interesting second level pointers are where you have second level
pointers that can point to differnet things or multiple features at once
based on an opaque switch. If you're looking for interesting second
level pointers look at bpf(). One example, is just the
BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD command wich passes a struct info which contains
an fd and depending on what type of fd that is, info can be either
struct bpf_prog_info, struct bpf_map_info, or struct bpf_btf_info some
of which can have other third level pointers in there.

[1]: There already wouldn't be any point to this if it were a first
     level pointer because you always need to determine the pid
     namespace hierarchy of the caller first to know whether or not you
     want to deny choosing a specific pid in a given namespace. That's
     nonsense.
