I only partly agree with that. I started the DRM documentation effort
because I had to write a driver, and there was no documentation. Writing
doc was indeed a way to learn, but it's a really high barrier to entry,
more difficult than "just" writing a new driver. You need a very high
level of motivation to do so, I don't think it's a suitable for someone
who has little technical knowledge of the Linux kernel for instance. It
also requires lots of time.

A fresh set of eyes can point to inconsistencies in the code while
writing documentation, but I don't share the view that we can consider
documentation writing as a good learning curve task in general, it
really requires lots of time and a strong incentive in addition to
documentation writing itself.

Are those proposed, ongoing or completed tasks ? If some are completed,
could you share information about what has been produced ?
