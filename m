Good question, but that is up to us. But FWIW, here is my stance:

I'd have no problem with those, but those are more devel internal issues
and nothing users would face, so I'm don't think it will buy us anything.

I'd say so, at least those that are regressions, as I want to track them ;-)

Well, the purpose of that list would be "make it easier to find existing
reports". Too much noise works against that, so we should try to limit
it, so maybe those are better left out, unless it's something we known
users might face.

Guess something like that might be best strategy.

Ciao, Thorsten
