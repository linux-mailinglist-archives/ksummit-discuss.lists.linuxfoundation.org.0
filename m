I prefer to have the entire series sent to linux-scsi or
target-devel. It wouldn't be so bad if discussions about the merits of a
tree-wide change consistently happened in responses to the cover
letter. But more often than not discussion happens in response to a
patch touching a different subsystem and therefore in a mail exchange
that doesn't end up on linux-scsi.

This was in response to a driver submission (for a different driver)
around the time this doc was written. The problem is that it's sometimes
hard to distinguish new warnings from old ones. I'm all for requiring
that no new warnings are introduced.

I'd really like all this patch submission guideline material to live in
Documentation/process. But yes.
