This sounds like the debates around rename-tracking in VCSes
circa 2005.

Other VCSes at the time had explicit rename tracking; git was
(and still is :) powerful enough to infer renames without extra
input from the user.

Drawing inspiration from git from not having "arch-id:" tags
or other cruft for rename-tracking; MY philosophy is to have
"Really Powerful Search" being able to tie things together
after-the-fact without user intervention.

The "Really Powerful Search" part is something I've been working
on in public-inbox off-and-on for a few years :)

I'm curious if you're taking advantage some of the public-inbox
search features (in lore.kernel.org) which is designed with
patches in mind.

1. "Phrase searching" with double quotes can be combined with the "s:"
   prefix to search most commit titles/subjects (*).

2. The dfa:/dfb: prefixes could be an alternative to "git blame"
   for searching text (and works for pre-git patches)

3. dfpre:/dfpost:/dfblob: can find exact blob SHA-1s

4. date/author can also match the git commit authorship info

5. all or any combination of the above can be combined in a single
   search to improve results

All the Xapian prefixes are documented at $INBOX_URL/_text/help/, e.g:
<https://public-inbox.org/git/_/text/help/>

I'm also planning to support searching for the output of
"git patch-id --stable" in the future.  public-inbox also lacks
pairity with "mairix -t" (being able to grab an entire thread
if on message in the thread matches).

(*) I'm also linking the phrase searching through cgit to link
    commit titles to mail discussions shown below:

    https://80x24.org/mirrors/git.git/commit/?id=b777f3fd619ac2af507ffd3e7c5fe0d6e36e81f2
    (following the "xdiff: clamp function context indices in post-image"
     link brings the public-inbox.org/git discussion)

    That's all done with a Lua script supported via cgit:
    https://80x24.org/public-inbox.git/tree/examples/cgit-commit-filter.lua
    It works OK in most cases, but would need to be combined (as
    noted in 5.) for best results.

    I haven't gotten dfpre/dfpost/dfblob/dfa/dfb links working via
    cgit + Lua, yet.  It's on my personal roadmap, some hacking on
    cgit will be needed to expose that info (and I keep getting
    sidetracked on other stuff)

This sounds exactly like the "arch-id:" comments GNU arch users
used to pollute their sources with for rename tracking :)

It's ugly and made redundant by something which understands
the content.

Change-Id also won't work for historical patches (including
pre-git stuff).  Even without relying on git blob IDs for search,
matching on exact text/phrases is pretty good for pre-git
patches, already.

And back to rename tracking, one yet-to-be-realized promise from
git's lack of explicit tracking was being able to track code
movements (individual functions or hunks, not just entire files).
Having a good search engine gets us there :)
