The truth is that I only ever read the documentation in front of the
function implementations.  And LDD.  ;)

There are some subsystems which document their functions in the
Documentation directory.  For example, pm_request_resume() is documented
in Documentation/power/runtime_pm.rst where it describes why it might
return 1 on success.  It would be awesome if we had an automated way to
find this.

I wish that there were a replacement for cscope which showed results in
a sorted order:

Global Implementation
Documentation
Local Implemenatations
(For me the struct device is my 995th result...  Cscope is terrible.
But it's what I use as my default search in the kernel source.  I just
would like to have one search for everything that would find
documentation as well).

regards,
dan carpenter
