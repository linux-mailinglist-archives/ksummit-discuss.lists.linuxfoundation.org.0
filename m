As a reminder, this vote is coming up. Some FAQs from last year on
virtual voting:

Q: What's the software used for voting?
A: We will be using the hosted version of the Condorcet Internet
Voting Service (CIVS) at https://civs.cs.cornell.edu

Q: Is this code open source?
A: Yes. The code is available under a BSD-like research license

Q: Is this method of voting secure?
A: Privacy and security is a focus of CIVS. See
https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/sec_priv.html for more information.

Q: The website mentions ranked choice voting. What is this?
A: In ranked choice voting, you rank your preferred choices from most
to least liked. The theory is this results in a more accurate
representation of what the voter pool wants.

Q: The description mentions an 'election supervisor'. What is this role?
A: The election supervisor's role is to start and stop the poll, send
links to voters, and set various options for the poll. A single e-mail
address is used to e-mail the link to manage the election, after which
anyone with the link can manage the poll.

Q: Who is the election supervisor for the TAB elections?
A: We have created a mailing list for election management, 
tab-elections@lists.linuxfoundation.org

Q: What if I lose the e-mail before I vote?
A: Please e-mail tab-elections@lists.linuxfoundation.org

Q: What if I want to change my vote?
A: This is not possible, please make sure you've made your final choices
when you click submit.

Q: What if I want to practice voting?
A: CIVS has a number of sample polls available. Feel free to vote in 
those to see how the process works.
