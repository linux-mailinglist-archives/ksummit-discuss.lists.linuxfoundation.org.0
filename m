I suspect the problem is that there's no known useful search string to
find a bug report even given a searchable set of lists, so the main
purpose of this list would be "if it's on here, it's a bug report" and
the triage team can cc additional lists as appropriate.  Then we simply
tell everyone to send kernel bugs to this list and ask maintainers to
cc it if a bug report shows up on their list?
