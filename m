The 2020 Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board election will be
closing tomorrow (Thursday) evening, US/Mountain time.  All LPC attendees
should have gotten a ballot at the address they used to register, as
should all others who have requested a ballot.  Results will be posted to
these lists once voting closes; please be sure to get your votes in before
then.

Thanks,

jon
