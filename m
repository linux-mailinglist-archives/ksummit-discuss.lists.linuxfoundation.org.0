Second that. Writing code usually seems more rewarding :)

I think we should make a distinction between adding new documentation
and updating the existing one. I agree that writing documentation is not
easy, especially when you need to write it from scratch. But making
small amends to the existing documentation along with the code changes
so that docs and code would still much is not that difficult. 
For such cases a request to have documentation update as a part of the
changes wouldn't be too much to ask.
