I swear that I was involved in a conversation in the past where
someone suggested to stop CCing LKML on patches and Jonathan Corbet
jumped in and said that he supported CCing LKML on all patches.  I
searched for that conversation and couldn't find it, so it's possible
I dreamed it.  Maybe he can confirm?

Right.  At this point I think LKML is just useful as a dumping ground
and not a place to look for patches or conversations without filters.
It feels fine to keep using it that way.  Having another list (like
ksummit-discuss) for conversations with a higher signal-to-noise ratio
seems like a fine way forward to me.
