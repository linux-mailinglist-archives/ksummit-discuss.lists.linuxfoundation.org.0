How about a convention to add a Reported-by: and a Link: to the
incremental fixup discussion? It's just polite to credit helpful
feedback, not sure it needs a more formal process.

Along those lines, how is this situation different than the feedback
that helps improve a patch that does not necessarily get credited by
Reviewed-by:? Links to thank you notes in cover letters seems more
appealing than moving more review / fix logs into the main history.
