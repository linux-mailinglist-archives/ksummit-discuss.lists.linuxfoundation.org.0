Right; this part of the patch provides a temporal explanation for "but
why now?" and acts as an internal reference, instead of pointing to
external[1] sources, which lack the Linux-specific contextualization.

Additionally, I think it provides rebuttals to many of the specious
arguments against inclusive terminology (and it could perhaps gain
more, as we've already seen in this thread, against slippery slope
arguments). It also attempts to acknowledge what this change in the
kernel processes provides to the world in general: it's a fairly local
change to make our development community less disruptive to those that
would seek to join it -- it does not, and cannot, solve global racism
(though that would be nice).
