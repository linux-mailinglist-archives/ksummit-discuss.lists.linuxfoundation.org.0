The key problem here is that it requires the committer to look
something up and perform a manual step.  IMO this means that the
adoption rate will be near to zero.  The reason that Change-Id
_doesn't_ require a manual step is that it's in your local commit
message and thus automatically stays there.  Thus inaction (leaving
the Change-Id alone as you spin the patch) produces the ideal
behavior.

What I see here is:

1. A valid reason to have a UUID is to help a machine that's
processing data.  Specifically UUIDs are well-formed and easy for a
machine to understand (unlike a link which could point to anything).

2. In the past you don't like UUIDs because the machines making sense
of them are private.

In this thread I am trying to argue that if we allow UUIDs in the
public email lists that anyone will be able to create a useful and
public database linking patch versions together.

The "It can be anything" is the problem with links.  Computers trying
to parse things like to have well-formed and well defined information.
Presumably if we had any chance of having computers parse these links
we need to have a _very_ will defined format for how a new version of
the patch points to the previous versions.  Everyone has to agree to
use the exact same well defined format.

--

NOTE: from reading all of this, one thing that I should probably be
able to do myself is:

1. Keep having Change-Id in my patches on my local computer.

2. Have the scripts I use to post upstream (which strips Change-Id out
before posting) encode the Change-Id into the Message-Id in a way that
it could be recovered, like:

Message-Id: Ic3e54798e4aeaa862b2e8eebcbbcef4e51ccae19-2018-1231-235959-1

...presumably that would have zero objections from anyone, but would
also be nearly useless since only my own patches would honor this
convention and the whole point is to later enable a machine to parse
them.
