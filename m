The documentation should say "Use get_maintainer.pl" and do what it
says.  Everything else is too complicated.

Occasionally staging maintainers will complain that they aren't CC'd
even though the staging/driver/README says to CC them and I am tell them
"No, the responsibility is for you to add yourself to MAINTAINERS.  It
doesn't matter what the documentation says, you messed up so you need to
stop getting annoyed with newbies for not reading the documentation when
it's your fault you weren't CC'd."

When I sent a patch, I use get_maintainer.pl then I add whoever the
wrote the commit from the Fixes tag.  Then I remove Colin King and Kees
Cook from the CC list because they worked all over the tree and I know
them.  I also normally remove LKML if there is another mailing list but
at least one subsystem uses LKML for patchwork so this isn't safe.

So the safest instructions are "Use get_matainer.pl and add the person
who wrote the commit in the Fixes tag".

dan carpenter
