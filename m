Hi Dan,

Thanks for taking the time to work on this patch and updating the
coding-style.rst with the with inclusive terminology guidelines and
adding a new document outlining the scope.

The suggestions you made will help us adapt inclusive terminology
for the current times, and also help us move toward terms that are
intuitive and easier to understand keeping our global developer
community in mind.

Allowlist/denylist terms are intuitive and action based which have a
globally uniform meaning.

Terms such as "whitelist" etc are contextual, hence assume contextual
knowledge on the part of the reader.

allowlist and blocklist or denylist are lot more intuitive than
white/black in any case.

allowlist/denylist makes the most sense than using colors.
