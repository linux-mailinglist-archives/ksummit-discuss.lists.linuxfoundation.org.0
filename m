I totally agree. A solid TODO list is necessary to channel efforts.

Also true. I New comers are intimidated to ask questions in the first
place and they might not get responses. It boils down to bandwidth
more often than not. People that know the sub-systems well might not
have time to document and more importantly keeping the documents
updated.

It definitely helps to that. I do see lots of calls without no comments
and usage information. For this to work, we have to give feedback during
the review process. This is necessary for commit logs as well.

I am interested in this topic as I help new developers and I often hear
the same concern that there aren't resources for them to learn and
understand kernel subsystems.

I have been reaching out to new contributors to kernel for the last
6 releases starting with Linux 5.1 asking

"What suggestions do you have for improving the materials and guidance
available to new contributors?"

The feedback always is request for updated information in kernel
documentation and online resources. I will be glad to share detailed
feedback if there is interest.

Addressing the need in providing kernel documentation could address
the need.

thanks,
