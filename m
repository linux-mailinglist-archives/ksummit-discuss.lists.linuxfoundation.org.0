You can't simply rename MAINTAINERS to .rst and let Sphinx handle it,
as:

	- The instructions at the top will be badly parsed;
	- It will also parse wrong the entries.

On the patches I wrote several years ago, I fixed the instructions
to make them to produce something that would produce a good output.
That's the easiest part.

For the entries contents, the simplest solution would be something like:

	diff --git a/MAINTAINERS b/MAINTAINERS
	index 6b4bc320e6ab..ae2afb14ae01 100644
	--- a/MAINTAINERS
	+++ b/MAINTAINERS
	@@ -147,4 +147,4 @@ F:	drivers/net/ethernet/3com/3c59x.c

A trivial change for a normal file, but doing this at MAINTAINERS
will be really painful, as it will cause lots of conflicts.

So, IMO, the best way to do it is to have a script (or to teach
get_maintainers.pl) to produce a ReST output that would do the
above.

The latest RFC about that with I sent was this one:

	https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1238576.html

I would probably address this on a different way those days.

A simple/lazy solution would be to apply the enclosed patch - or a
variant of it that would place the contents of MAINTAINERS outside
process/index.html, and add instructions about how to use
get_maintainers.pl.

Jon,

Please let me know if you're willing to accept something like that.

Thanks,
Mauro

[PATCH RFC] docs: process: add MAINTAINERS file contents

Anyone working with the Kernel need to consider the contents of the
MAINTAINERS file. So, add it to the ReST output.
