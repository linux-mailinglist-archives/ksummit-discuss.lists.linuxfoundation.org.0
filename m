The datacenter that went with full bypass of kernel storage and networking
subsystems where application don't do many syscalls per second any more ?
Sure. In such cases extreme seccomp overhead is irrelevant.
Just like kpti and retpoline overhead.

Are you running in interpreted mode? Otherwise above statement is nonsense or
you haven't done eBPF benchmarking in long time. JITed eBPF has exact same
speed as kernel C code. Even extreme use cases of bpf programs with single
'return 0' instruction are being optimized into minimal number of native
instructions.
So with above you're saying that giant bitmask of syscalls in C code
is faster than 'int foo() { return 0; }' in C code ? Simply absurd.
You realize that eBPF is processing tens of millions of packets per second
and folks measure the overhead in nanoseconds.
Indirect call and retpoline overhead was removed from a lot bpf use cases
in networking specifically because every nanosecond counts.

It's subjectively safer. I argue it's enjoying smaller bug rate because
syzbots are not looking into it and it's not being actively developed.
In the year 2020 there were three verifier bugs that could have been exploited
through unpriv. All three were found by new kBdysch fuzzer. In 2019 there was
nothing. Not because people didn't try, but because syzbot reached its limit.
The pace of bpf development is accelerating. There will be more bugs found and
introduced in the verifier. Yet that doesn't stop folks to use eBPF to secure
the datacenters.
The JITs are also being developed. There are bugs in them and they affect both
cBPF and eBPF. If you're worried about that it's probably time to get rid of
cBPF from seccomp. Invent your own syscall processing thingy, fix bugs and stop
adding new features. That's the only way to reduce the bug rate. We're not
going to slow down JITs development because of seccomp.
