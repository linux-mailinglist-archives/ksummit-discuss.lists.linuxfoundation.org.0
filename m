W1 the largest? Really?

A "controller" is also any block of electronics that performs a function
involving a state machine.
So for SPI and I2C, we'll have Linux drivers talking to an "SPI controller
controller", an "SPI device controller", an "I2C controller controller",
and an "I2C device controller".
For W1, Linux is still limited to supporting "W1 controller controllers",
but supporting "W1 device controllers" might be just beyond the horizon...

And when does the "gadget" enter the show? ;-)

P.S. In Dutch, we just assimilate all English technical words, and
     they'll only have that specific meaning.  E.g. if someone
     talks about the "cloud", even lay people know they're not talking
     about those things that may ruin your holiday outside.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
