Yeah, as this is a database, instead of just outputting it on a
formatted way, it is possible to generate other types of output.

We could, for example, have an extension with would implement something like:

	.. maintainers:: <subdir>

Which would call get-maintainers in order to parse a subsystem-specific
set of entries and printing the maintainership details.

This could be added at the subsystem-specific profile, for the subsystems
that have it.

Even if we go for adding a Sphinx tag that would produce a parsed
output for a system-specific profile, we'll still have several other
subsystems that won't have a profile for a while, so I would still 
consider having somewhere an output with its contents. Yeah, someone
might be tempted to print it, but we could place it on a separate PDF,
in order to minimize the risks of someone printing the 300+ pages.
