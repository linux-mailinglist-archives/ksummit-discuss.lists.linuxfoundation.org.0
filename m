Agreed.  And, I believe the key is to establish the standard way to
report a regression from each subsystem maintainer side.  That is,
instead of a "regression manager" gathering the regression reports
alone by him/herself, we let each maintainer reporting the regression
more easily to a central place.  And there we simply gather and
provide the link to each regression report on a dashboard.

Of course, this would need educations to each maintainer and
developer, but it should be more scalable and sustainable than a
top-down model.

Takashi
