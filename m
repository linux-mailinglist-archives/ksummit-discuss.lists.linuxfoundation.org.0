So I'm finally back home after my European tour, and I have it on good
authority that my bag might even get here eventually too.  That means I'm
digging through a pile of docs stuff I've been neglecting badly...

My intention is to apply these patches.  But as I was reading through
them, one little nagging thing came to mind...

Thus far, the maintainer guide is focused on how to *be* a maintainer.
This document, instead, is more about how to deal with specific
maintainers.  So I suspect that Documentation/maintainer might be the
wrong place for it.

Should we maybe place it instead under Documentation/process, or even
create a new top-level "book" for this information?

Thanks,

jon
