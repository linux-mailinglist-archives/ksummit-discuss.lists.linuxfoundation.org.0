Please don't do this, as it means the patch won't be findable on the
"LKML" patchwork instance at:

https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/

Having LKML copied on all patches is also nice because it makes it
easier to respond to a patch that was posted to a list you didn't
subscribe to.  I subscribe to LKML and have it redirected to a folder
that I never look at.  Then if I want to find an email thread I can
search that folder and easily respond from within my normal email
client.

Is there any downside to CCing LKML?
