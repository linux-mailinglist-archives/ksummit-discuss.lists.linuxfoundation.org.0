It was joke, but the reality is even more exciting.

See commit 71cc849b7093 ("KVM: x86: Fix split-irqchip vs interrupt injection window request")
for the need of "Reported-Analyzed-Reviewed-Tested-by:" tag.

And endless amount of commits with "Reviewed-Signed-by:" from maintainers that gives wrong
impression that other maintainers merge code without reviewing it.
