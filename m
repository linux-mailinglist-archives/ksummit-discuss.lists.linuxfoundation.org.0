Well, some are actually useful and not about reviewer's preferred style :) But
if an author redoes the patch as a result, it's their choice to mention useful
improvements in the next version's change log.

Right, let's focus on fixes and reports of bugs, that would have resulted in a
standalone commit, but don't.

Standardizing the Fixes-from: tag (or any better name) would be a forward
progress, yes.

"Reported-by:" becomes ambiguous once the bugfix for the reported issue in the
patch is folded, as it's no longer clear whether the bot reported the original
issue the patch is fixing, or a bug in the fix. So we should have a different
variant. "Fixes-reported-by:" so it has the same prefix?
