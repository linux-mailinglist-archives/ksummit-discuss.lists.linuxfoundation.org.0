I agree with Laurent.  I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but
I think you need something to indicate the voter approval policy
besides "the TAB will decide it, and can change it when they like".

I suppose the pool of voters has been decided historically by the Kernel
Summit invitation committee.  Some randomness was introduced by
allowing voting by attendees from whatever event the Linux Foundation
co-located with the Kernel Summit.  I think in practical terms,
this means that recently the voting pool was self-selected (somewhat), but
was skewed towards people who could travel, or had employer support.
But in any event, the selection of the voting pool was done by people outside
the TAB (or at least not necessarily inside the TAB), and without any eye towards
skewing the election results.  That is, I don't think the kernel summit invitation
committee, or the LF event staff, ever considered TAB voting in their KS attendee
selection or event pairing choices.

I don't think that the current TAB would do anything wacky here.  And I suspect
it's probably not a huge concern even for future TABs whose constitution we don't
know yet. I do think, however, it would be better to have a written policy
for the voting eligibility, that the TAB members can't change on a whim.
