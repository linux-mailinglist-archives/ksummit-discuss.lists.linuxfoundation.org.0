Git notes have a limited usefulness for this -- they are indeed part of 
the repository, but they aren't replicated unless someone does a 
--mirror clone (or specifically fetches refs/notes/*). If the goal is to 
improve visibility for contributors, then putting this info into a git 
note will hardly make more difference than providing a Link: that 
someone has to follow to a list archival service.

I can offer the following proposal:

- kernel.org already monitors all mailing lists that are archived on 
  lore.kernel.org for the purposes of pull request tracking 
  (pr-tracker-bot).
- in the near future, we will add a separate process that will 
  auto-explode all pull requests into individual patches and add them
  to a separate public-inbox archive (think of it as another 
  transparency log, since pull requests are transient and opaque).

We can additionally:

- identify all Link: and Message-Id: entries in commit messages, 
  retrieve the threads they refer to, and archive them as part of the 
  same (or adjacent) transparency log.

This offers an improvement over the status quo, because if 
lore.kernel.org becomes unavailable, someone would have to have access 
to all backend archive repositories it is currently tracking in order to 
be able to reconstitute relevant conversations -- whereas with this 
change, it should be sufficient to just have the copy of the 
transparency log to have a fully self-contained high-relevancy archive 
of both individual commits and conversations that happened around them.

I'm just not sure if this will help with the subject of the 
conversation, or if it does not serve the goal of recognizing developer 
contributions by making them more visible.
