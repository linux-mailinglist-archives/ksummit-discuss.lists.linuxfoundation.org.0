Hi Geert,

This is what still makes most sense to me. You can express e.g. that you
like a patch series and approve the general approach taken but haven't
gone for the gory details -> Acked-by (a short explaining paragraph
would make sense, then, too)

Is that old fashioned?

Acked-by only for maintainers doesn't make sense to me. Neiher does when
Acked-by has a different meaning for maintainers and non-maintainers.

I still see this as a "looks OK to me" variant. A patch is good enough
to enter my subsystem. Sometimes, I also use "Reviewed-by" for this,
namely when I thoroughly looked at (=3Dreviewed) a patch.

As I wrote before, I don't want to enforce that. But spread the word
that it is good to have and should be done and common sense should apply.

For me, Acked-by would do here.

Thanks,
