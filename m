The lei (local email interface) data model will have "labels"(*)
and developers will be able to publish mail with it via static
HTML/Atom/JSON feed via cronjob and whatnot.

lei could offer read-write JMAP support; either as a CGI tied
to Unix user accounts or some virtual user system.  Some fixes
I'm currently making to speed up the test suite will also make
it more suitable for a largish virtual user system.

lei will be MY dream mail/git tool that fills in the gaps
left by other tools; I hope it can make others happy, too :)

Heh, same here.  Once I start using lei to handle all of my mail
and there's a data-loss bug, I could conceivably never know
about it because the bug reports would be lost... :x


[1] "labels" are "mailboxes" in JMAP-speak; and lei's per-user data
    model will be tied to JMAP.  "keywords" are Maildir/IMAP-system
    flags (seen/flagged/answered/...).  JMAP doesn't allow arbitrary
    keywords, but does allow arbitrary labels.
