I suspect it's at least partly because "allow" and "list" are both verbs
-- in fact, "list" is the actual verb in "I will allow-list it", and
"allow" is being used to modify the verb "list". But because "allow" is
usually a verb, the sentence sounds like there are two verbs in there
when there should only be one. I expect our ears will get trained to
accept that sentence once you encounter "allowlist" often enough.
