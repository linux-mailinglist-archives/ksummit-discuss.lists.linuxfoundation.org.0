How about we make the standard, "Would this fix be backported to stable?"

For example, if you have a signedness bugs:

 	ret = frob(unsigned_long_size);
-	if (ret < unsigned_long_size)
+	if (ret < 0 || ret < unsigned_long_size)
vs:
+	if (ret < (int)unsigned_long_size)
		goto whatever;

To me, whoever fixes the bug gets to choose their prefered style but
maybe some reviewers have strong feelings one way or the other.

No, I mean people add Reported-by tags for fixes to the original commit
like in commit f026d8ca2904 ("igc: add support to eeprom, registers and
link self-tests").
