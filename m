Hm, I've spoken in favour of the Link: approach for upstream purposes.
But I do see the point in making it possible for people to somehow have
a workflow involving change-ids that does not interfer with regular
upstream expectations, i.e. no Change-Ids in commit messages.

One thing that came up was to place stuff like Change-Id after the ---
which git format-patch would leave out. This still has the problem
though that a git merge will keep the stuff after the --- and so a git
tag followed by a git request-pull would have the stuff in there as well
afaict. So I wonder if you couldn't simply enable Gerrit to look for
stuff like Change-Ids in git notes. They wouldn't show up on merges and
pulls afaict...
