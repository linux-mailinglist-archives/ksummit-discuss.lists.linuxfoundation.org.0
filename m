First of all - thanks for a very detailed email.

+1. Yes priority is probably a bigger reason. We can make time for the
things we care about. In general documentation isn't fun for engineers
and also not as glamorous.

Correct. Media subsystem does this very well and can be held up as an
example for good documentation mainly because media maintainers
emphasize and make it a priority. I have been well trained by to start
with documentation when I am doing media work. :)

I follow this for the driver I maintain and kselftest. The latter not
as successfully. It is harder to have a cohesive strategy for subsystem
or an area that is generic and have more people involved, unless
everybody is on board and agree that documentation is important.

Yes. That is also correct. The way I address it depending on bandwidth
is working during the reviews to get get documentation right, when I
consider it very important to understand the patch and be able to
maintain it later.

Right. I find myself in the same place as you. I end up asking for info.
which annoys people at times. I find documenting work is an important
step in the development process. I might be in the minority, however, at
times, as I am writing my commit log explaining what I am doing in a
patch in, I find a better way to fix a problem.

So I find it useful and I also use it as learning tool. When I attempt
document or explain a concept or an area, I get a deeper understanding
of that area. I would counter the argument that new developers can't
document an area, they can and the document can be reviewed by experts.
I have had some level of success adding documentation tasks in the
mentoring program. It does requires experts spending time reviewing to
make sure it is correct.

The larger problem goes back to, documentation isn't glamorous. It
isn't valued at the same level of code. If we collectively agree that
it is, then we can make it happen. We might sending a wrong message
by saying "Code walks ...". I understand what we mean by that we don't
want a long proposal and we would rather see code.

Maybe we can amend it to say "Code with good documentation walks ...".

The documentation in my mind includes:

commit logs
doc area at the top of functions declarations
API documentation

thanks,
