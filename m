Other examples include (possibly epoll_ctl's struct epoll_event),
struct iovec in general, {get,set}_robust_list(), kexec_load()'s struct
kexec_segment, and sendmsg()'s and recvmsg()'s sruct msghdr with a large
number of additional substructs passed through passing a struct iovec.
Most of these I reckon are uninteresting and will just in general be not
allowed if there's a problem.
