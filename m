I don't think so. Perhaps we could add, instead, something like that at the
sub-maintainers section of the profile.

Yeah, I have plans to automate it, the same way we did for pull
requests. I'm planning to do that later, after upgrading patchwork
to the current upstream version (with requires upgrading some libraries
too at the server).

In any case, having this at the profile is a reminder for whomever is 
submitting a patch that it should be clean for static analyzers too.

Gah... where this "send" came from??? :-p

Any suggestions for a lighter text with similar meaning? :-)

Yeah, I see. Yet, IMHO, we should either not add anything about checkpatch
warnings that might not be relevant or add something similar like the above.

Thanks,
