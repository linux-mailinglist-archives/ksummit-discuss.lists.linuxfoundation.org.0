In theory, yes, in practice, as long as there is an exception to the
rule, it comes down to a question of "is this case special like net or
not?". I'd rather not waste time debating that on a per-subsystem
basis vs just getting it all documented for contributors.

I do think it is worth clarifying in the guidelines of writing a
profile to make an effort to not be special, and that odd looking
rules will be questioned (like libnvdimm statement continuation), but
lets not fight the new standards fight until it becomes apparent where
the outliers lie.
