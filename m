I've worked on the Linux Kernel still 1991, and have worked on the tty
subsystem, serial driver, real-time linux, ext2/3/4 and e2fsprogs.  I
served on the board of the Free Standards Group (one of the
predecessor organizations to the Linux Foundations), as well as
Usenix, and have served on the program committee of many conferences
including Usenix ATC, FAST, Vault, LinuxCon, and the Linux
Kernel/Maintaiiner's Summit.

If I am re-elected to the TAB, I'd like to work with the various
conferences and workshops to better balance the technical work that
gets done at these events, so that members of our community can meet
with the people they need to meet, in a product setting, without
certain conferences --- such as the Linux Plumbers Conference ---
becoming heavily oversubscribed and over-crowded.  In my opinion, this
means we need to create or strengthen a strong technical conference
which meets in the first half the year, which can serve as a Linux
Systems Conference as vital and as exciting as the LPC is in the
second half of the year.  Clearly, we have a lot more technical work
that we would like to do that can be accomodated by having a single
really great conference once a year!

I am also interested in helping to reinvigorate the Linux Foundation's
Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII).  No, it's not completely dead,
in that even in 2019, it's still funding some great work, but it
certainly has the appearance of "Pining for the Fjords".  We need to
improve its fund-raising capacity, remove cobwebs from its web site,
and make sure it can be more responsive to proposals sent to it.
While this isn't a TAB function, I think there are opportunities for
the TAB as a body, and for individual TAB members, to help the CII
be as successful as it was when it first started.
