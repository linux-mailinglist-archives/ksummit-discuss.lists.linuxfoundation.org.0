I don't totally agree on that, because like the CoC discussion, people
need concrete examples. People need reasons, saying simply "be
inclusive" doesn't work.

You say "be inclusive" people don't think about it, they just go "I'm
inclusive" and proceed, never questioning what it means to be
inclusive, they normalise inclusivity to their self image and within
their lives where they might never confront anything like this.

I don't doubt we get the American/Ottoman/Barbery coast people and the
correct answer to those people is to tell them to examine why they
suddenly care about Barbery slavery now when they have never even
heard or worried about it before. Why haven't they submitted patches
removing slavery terminology from the kernel before?

Dave.
