Yes, I know. I agreed[1] with you on this point.

I don't expect to need to do anything with variable lengths in the
seccomp BPF dialect. As I said in the other thread, if we are faced with
design trade-offs that require extending the seccomp filter language, we
would switch to eBPF.

Making universal declarations based on your opinion does not help
convince people of your position. Saying it's "unusable in production
datacenter" is perhaps true for you, but hardly true for the many
datacenters that do use it.

Additionally, we're obviously not interested in making seccomp _slower_.
The entire point of an investigation of the design is to examine our
options and find the right solution.

Yes -- because it's an order of magnitude faster than even a single
instruction BPF seccomp filter. The vast majority of seccomp filters need
nothing more than a single yes/no, and right now the bulk of processing
time is spent running the BPF filter. I would prefer to avoid BPF
entirely where possible for seccomp.

> Which means more kernel code, more bugs, more security issues.

Right. This is a solid design principle, and one I agree with: avoid
adding code, keep things simple, everything will have bugs. And, as it
stands, seccomp has had a significantly safer history than eBPF, largely
due to its goal of staying as utterly small and simple as possible. I
don't intend to discard that stance, and it's why I would rather continue
to shield seccomp from the regularly occurring eBPF flaws.

Thanks to the neighboring thread here, the requirements no longer[2]
include nested args. Also, you're mixing bitmasks (to accelerate the
overwhelmingly common case) with the deep argument inspection (which is
a rare but needed case).

Yup, we all agree. :)
