The term slave carries a lot more meaning than subordinate. I replied to
someone else but later realized that the person sent me their reply
offlist, so my reply to them was also offlist. What I told them was,
back in college (decades ago), when I first mentioned "master/slave" in
conversation (I think it was about hard drives), a person in that
conversation stated that those were not very nice terms to use. I blew
it off back then, but after listening to more people, I found that
using "slave" even to describe a device is not something that people
care to hear about.

And in actuality, does one device actually enslave another device? I
think that terminology is misleading to begin with.
