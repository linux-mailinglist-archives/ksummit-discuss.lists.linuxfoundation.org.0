Ahh, nice, thx to everyone working on that!

Out of curiosity: will that work for other bug trackers as well? Like
the gitlab instance used by the drm developers? It's not really
important and I guess the answer will be "no", but the question came up
while at it...

Exactly. Due to my work on reporting-issues.rst I try to look at it from
the users point of view. And they currently have no easy way to search
for existing reports without getting lots of other stuff mixed into the
results they are not interested in. That makes it hard. :-/

If one exists ;-)

Could, but I fear it might fail, as modifying the subject is a little
unusual to the normal working style; but "adding people and appropriate
mailing lists to the CC" OTOH is something that people do every day.

And that's why I still think having a separate list is the best idea.
But using tags is totally fine for me, if that the general consensus.

Ciao, Thorsten
