Correct. But if we don't change the voting requirements, and the conference
is canceled, or people are restricted from traveling, then those people
will not be able to vote with the current charter.

We are trying to extend who can vote beyond those that the charter allows.
We are not preventing those that can vote under the current rules from
voting.  IIUC, we are trying to create absentee voting which we never had
before. Thus, you can either vote the current way by getting travel to
wherever Kernel Summit is and attending the conference, or we can extend
the charter so that if you can not come for whatever reason, you have an
option to vote remotely, if you satisfy the new requirements. Remember, not
attending means you do not satisfy the current requirements.

The TAB has bikeshed this a bit internally, and came up with the conclusion
that kernel.org accounts is a very good "first step". If this proves to be
a problem, we can look at something else. This is why we are being a bit
vague in the changes so that if something better comes along we can switch
to that. After some experience in various methods (if we try various
methods), we could always make whatever method works best as an official
method at a later time.

But for now, we need to come up with something that makes it hard for
ballot stuffing, and a kernel.org account (plus activity in the kernel)
appears to be the best solution we know of.
