Ah, now I see how I confused you.  The two cases I mentioned in the
above are completely individual.  They were found in two different
drivers.  I put those just as two distinct examples for the passive

What I meant about the latter was that "not in allowlist" doesn't mean
it being "in denylist".  It's simply unknown.
