Guibas and Robert Sedgewick derived the red-black tree from the symmetric binary B-tree.[7] The color "red" was chosen because it was the best-looking color produced by the color laser printer available to the authors while working at Xerox PARC.[8] Another response from Guibas states that it was because of the red and black pens available to them to draw the trees.[9]

I don't think it's helpful to rename a standard piece of computing terminology unless it's actually hurting us to have it. Obviously if it were called a "master-slave" tree, I would be in favour of renaming it.

As I said "it means nothing if you've never interacted with gambling
culture," red black in the context of the trees as zero meaning other
than as a name to find it on the internet, Search for that name enough
and you will undoubtedly be getting ads for online roulette sites
within hours, if you have a problem gambling past, this might not be
the desired effect you'd want.

The reasons something was named a particular thing can and will be
different from what a societal context for them means now, and I
believe it's more important to worry about current societal contexts
than legacy historical namings. I'm not seriously suggesting we rename
red-black trees, but if someone who had a problematic gambling
background had issues with them I'd definitely be open for considering
it.

Dave.
